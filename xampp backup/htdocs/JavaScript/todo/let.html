        //redeclaring a varibale with var can create problems
        //if we declare 6 outside a function and redclare that as 5 inside thew function it will become 5 outside of the function
        //also to avoid this create variables with let because let have block scope , it doesnt reassign the value outside 
        //the function
        //redeclaring the var variable with let is not allowed in any scope

        //redeclaring with let variable with let also not alloweed

        //redeclaring a let variable outside and inside was allowed
